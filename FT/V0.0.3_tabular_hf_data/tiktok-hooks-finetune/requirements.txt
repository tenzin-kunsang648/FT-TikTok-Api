# Lambda Deployment Requirements - TikTok Virality Prediction
#
# Why we need this file:
# Lambda doesn't have ML libraries pre-installed. We must package all dependencies.
# Using specific versions ensures reproducibility and avoids compatibility issues.
#
# Why specify exact versions?
# Ensures consistency between development and production. Prevents
# breaking changes from library updates. Critical for ML models where even
# minor numpy version differences can change predictions.

# Minimal dependencies for Lambda deployment
# Only what's actually needed for XGBoost inference

numpy==1.24.3           # Required by XGBoost and for array operations
pandas==2.0.3           # Required for DataFrame feature engineering
scipy==1.11.3           # Required by XGBoost and scikit-learn internally
scikit-learn==1.3.0     # Required for StandardScaler and LabelEncoder
xgboost==2.0.3          # Our trained models

# Removed: lightgbm (not used in production)
# Total: ~180-220 MB

# Note: We trained with these versions locally
# Lambda package must use SAME versions or predictions may differ!

# Why these specific libraries?
# - numpy: Array operations, mathematical functions
# - pandas: DataFrame operations for feature engineering
# - scikit-learn: Preprocessing (StandardScaler, LabelEncoder)
# - xgboost: Regression and classification models
# - lightgbm: Alternative model (we have it trained, might switch later)

# Package size considerations:
# - numpy: ~30 MB
# - pandas: ~40 MB  
# - scikit-learn: ~30 MB
# - xgboost: ~50 MB
# - lightgbm: ~20 MB
# Total: ~170 MB (within 250 MB limit ✓)

# For larger packages => Lambda Layers or container images
